<h1 align="center">❓ What is 'Predator Lite'?</a></h1>
The last itteration to the 'Predator' lineup. Predator Lite has been designed to remain discreet, offering similar features to the main predator software but with limited values. Predator Lite is targetted towards those drivers who want that slight edge on the rest of the lobby. Where before Predator offered 1000x power multipler, the feedback that we got was that it was hard to remain incognito when using predator, we have now decided the best course of action to address this issue is to create predator lite.
