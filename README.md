# Predator Lite: Elevate Your Game with Subtle Precision

Introducing **Predator Lite**, the latest innovation in our renowned Predator software lineup. Designed for drivers who seek a competitive edge without drawing attention, Predator Lite offers a discreet yet powerful enhancement to your racing experience.

## Seamless Integration and Subtle Performance

Predator Lite integrates seamlessly with your existing gaming setup, providing a smoother and more refined experience. Unlike the original Predator, which boasts a staggering 1000x power multiplier, Predator Lite is engineered to deliver a more subtle boost, ensuring you stay under the radar while still gaining that crucial advantage over your competitors.

## Key Features:

- **Stealth Mode Enhancements**: Predator Lite maintains the essence of the Predator series but with a reduced power output, making it nearly undetectable. Enjoy enhanced performance without the risk of standing out.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The intuitive interface of Predator Lite is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing for easy customization and quick adjustments on the fly. Tailor your settings to match your unique racing style effortlessly.

## Current version support:

- The only tested version is **CSP 0.1.79**. We do not provide support for any other version.
- Predator Lite will not be maintained for future versions of CSP, we are moving to 'Nemesis'.

## Why Choose Predator Lite?
